# Media Query Feature Improvements

## Validation

- [ ] Add compile-time validation for media query syntax to catch invalid queries early
- [ ] Provide helpful error messages for malformed media selectors

## Container Queries

- [ ] Add support for CSS container queries (`@container`)
- [ ] Distinguish between `@media` and `@container` selectors

## Media Query Combinations

- [ ] Support `or` combinations (comma-separated media queries). Current limitation: multiple conditions only join with `and`

## Developer Experience

- [ ] Add TypeScript autocomplete hints for common media features
- [ ] Document all supported media query formats in README
- [ ] Add more examples for complex responsive patterns
