Fix Windows path handling and Next.js/Vite integration issues.

**Posix paths internally (`@mochi-css/builder`):** All internal paths now use forward slashes regardless of platform. A new `path` utility (exported from the package) wraps Node's system path operations and normalizes output to forward slashes; `fromSystemPath`/`toSystemPath` convert at filesystem boundaries. `findAllFiles` accepts and returns posix paths; `parseFile` converts to system path only for the `fs.readFile` call. This eliminates silent CSS injection failures on Windows caused by mixed path separators in `Module.filePath`, manifest keys, and virtual module IDs.

**Dev mode deadlock (`@mochi-css/next`, `@mochi-css/postcss`):** When `withMochi()` starts its file watcher it sets a process-level flag. The PostCSS plugin now checks this flag and skips its own build entirely, emitting a one-time warning instead. Previously both ran `collectMochiCss()` concurrently via separate `RolldownBundler` instances, deadlocking on Windows.

**Production double-build (`@mochi-css/next`):** `withMochi()` now adds a webpack `beforeRun` plugin that runs a one-shot CSS build before webpack starts. Previously the PostCSS plugin raced with the webpack loader on first build, leaving `.mochi/manifest.json` missing and requiring a second `next build`.

**Global CSS injection (`@mochi-css/next`, `@mochi-css/vite`):** The webpack loader and Vite transform hook now unconditionally inject the global CSS import when one is present, regardless of whether the file has per-file CSS. Previously, files with no per-file entry skipped global injection entirely when `splitCss: false`.

**Tsuki nextjs preset (`@mochi-css/tsuki`):** The `nextjs` preset no longer registers `@mochi-css/postcss`. The `withMochi()` watcher (dev) and `beforeRun` pre-build (prod) cover all CSS needs for Next.js without PostCSS. Both the `vite` and `nextjs` presets now also append `.mochi` to `.gitignore`. `createMochiConfigModule` accepts a `splitCss` option; the `nextjs` preset passes `splitCss: true` by default.
